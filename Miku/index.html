        <h1>About Miku!</h1>
        <p>Hatsune Miku is a virtual pop star and Vocaloid software voicebank developed by Crypton Future Media, released in 2007. Her voice is synthesized using Yamaha’s Vocaloid technology, and she’s portrayed as a 16-year-old girl with long turquoise twin-tails. Miku quickly became a global icon thanks to her unique blend of music, tech, and fan creativity. She performs live as a 3D hologram, drawing crowds worldwide, and has collaborated with major artists and brands. Beyond music, she’s a symbol of digital culture and fan-driven innovation.</p>
